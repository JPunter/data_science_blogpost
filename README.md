# Data Science Blogpost
Data analysis repository for Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree blogpost project

# Installation 
Extra libraries that are not installed with the Anaconda distribution, as well as what what version of python you are using should be noted.
There should be no neccessary additional libraries required other than the ones installed by default with Anaconda Python.
Python 3.* should allow the code to run without issues

# Project Motivation
For this project I was interested in international health statistics to better understand:
1. What factors affect life expectancy
2. What regions of the world have the highest and lowest life expectancy
3. How development status affects life expectancy
4. If I can reliably predict life expectancy based on the data available here

# File Descriptions
None currently

# Results
The results of this analysis can be found in a blog post here(insert hyperlink when done)
